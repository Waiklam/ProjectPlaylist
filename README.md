# Project Playlist

## Overview

This is a project that I created that allows users to create new/edit existing Spotify playlists using the Spotify API. I made this because there isn't a convenient way to make a Spotify playlist (aside from searching the songs and adding manually). This app allows users to see whats in their playlists while editing them.

## Using the Application

5. Start the server with:
```bash
  npm start
```
